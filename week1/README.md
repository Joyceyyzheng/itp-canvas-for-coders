## Developing ideas

### Statement

#### Undone, Ã“lafur Arnalds

```
As we get bigger and bigger  
The distance between ourselves  
And that other outside world  
Becomes smaller and smaller

And this world that we are inside  
Which seems so huge in the beginning  
And so infinitely welcoming  
Has become very uncomfortable  
And we are obliged to be born  

And my father says that  
Birth is so chaotic and violent  
That he's sure that at the moment of birth  
We're all thinking  

"This is it"  
"This is death"  
"This is the end of my life"  
And then we're born and it's a surprise  
'Cause it's just the beginning
```
