## Developing ideas through statements
```
Visualization of the progress of human lifetime in an abstract and minimal composition.
```

```
Sometimes I imagine myself in an infinite room, completely isolated from the outside world.
In that space, only vast thoughts exist, and it would take million years to reach the edge.
```

```
A recently deceased man returns as a ghost to his suburban home to console his bereft wife,
only to find that in his spectral state, he has become stuck in time,
forced to watch passively as the life he knew and the woman he loves slowly slip away.

- A Ghost Story
```

```
As we get bigger and bigger
The distance between ourselves
And that other outside world
Becomes smaller and smaller

And this world that we are inside
Which seems so huge in the beginning
And so infinitely welcoming
Has become very uncomfortable
And we are obliged to be born

And my father says that
Birth is so chaotic and violent
That he's sure that at the moment of birth
We're all thinking

"This is it"
"This is death"
"This is the end of my life"
And then we're born and it's a surprise
'Cause it's just the beginning

- Undone, Ã“lafur Arnalds
```

```
Are we alone?
```
